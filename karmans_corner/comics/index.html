	alt="Pow!">

	<p>Everyone likes to ask me, "Karman, which do you like more? Marvel or DC?" to
		to which I answer with nervous chuckles. Because how does one really measure
		which they like <em><strong>more</em></strong>?</p>

	<p>Instead of answering such a preposterous question, I'll list all my favorite
		superheroes! Well. I guess not <em>all</em>, because, well because that would
		take all day!</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Batman</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Batman (DC) does not possess any superpowers; rather, he relies on his
			genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective
			skills, etc.</p>
