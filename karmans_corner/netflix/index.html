	<h2>A detailed list of my favorite shows on Netflix (in no particular order!)!</h2>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Chuck</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>Chuck is an action-comedy/spy-drama television series about an</p> 
<p>"average computer-whiz-next-door" named Chuck who receives an encoded </p>
<p>e-mail from an old college friend now working for the CIA.</p>
<p>... To put the whole thing <em><strong>simply</em></strong>.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>LOST</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>Lost is a drama series containing elements of science fiction </p>
<p>and the supernatural. It follows the survivors of the crash of a</p>
<p>commercial passenger jet, flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, on</p>
<p>a mysterious tropical island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. </p>
<p>Again, this is <strong><em>seriously</em></strong> simplifying the plot.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>House</li>
	</ul>
