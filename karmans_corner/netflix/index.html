	<h2>A detailed list of my favorite shows on Netflix (in no particular order!)!</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Chuck</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Chuck is an action-comedy/spy-drama television series about an
		"average computer-whiz-next-door" named Chuck who receives an encoded
		e-mail from an old college friend now working for the CIA.</p>

	<p>... To put the whole thing <em><strong>simply</em></strong>.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>LOST</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Lost is a drama series containing elements of science fiction
		and the supernatural. It follows the survivors of the crash of a
		commercial passenger jet, flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, on
		a mysterious tropical island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean.</p>

	<p>Again, this is <strong><em>seriously</em></strong> simplifying the plot.</p>

	alt="Wallpaper of the show 'Lost'.">

	<ul>
		<li>House M.D</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The series follows a team of diagnosticians at "Princeton Plainsboro teaching
		hospital" led by misanthrope medical genius, Greg House, MD. Dealing with drug
		addiction and poor people skills House is tasked with diagnosing the undiagnosable.</p>

	<p>It's really good!</p>

	alt="Wallpaper of the show 'House M.D'.">

	<ul>
		<li>How I Met Your Mother</li>
	</ul>

	<p>A father recounts to his children, through a series of flashbacks (eight
		seasons of flashbacks!), the journey he and his four best friends took
		leading up to him meeting their mother.</p>

	<p>One of the greatest shows I've watched! Spoiler, the ending was disappointing.</p>

	alt="Wallpaper of the show 'How I Met Your Mother'.">

	<ul>
		<li>Mad Men</li>
	</ul>

	<p>A drama about one of New York's most prestigious ad agencies at the beginning
		of the 1960s, focusing on one of the firm's most mysterious but extremely
		talented ad executives, Donald Draper.</p>

	<p>Cinematically <strong><em>amazing</em></strong>.</p>
