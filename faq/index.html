	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions:</h1>
	
	<p>Being such a knowledgable person doesn't come easy.</p>
	<p>Here are some questions I get asked daily:</p>
	
	
	
	<ul>
		<li>Q: "Was that due today?"</li>
	</ul>
		<p>A: Shoot, yes it was!
	
	<ul>
		<li>Q: "Do you have a pencil I can borrow?"</li>
	</ul>
		<p>A: Psssh. Who do you think I am? Someone who's generally prepared for things?</p>
		
	<ul>
	<li>Q: "Do you spell your name with 'e,' and 'a,' or an 'i'?"</li>
	</ul>
		<p>I mean, my name <em>is</em> spelled with an 'a' - 'Karman' but it's pronounced the</p>
		<p>same, whether you spell it 'Karmin' or 'Karmen'. But to answer your question,</p>
		<p>it's spelled with an 'a'.</p>
